    <h2>Emotional significance</h2>
    <p>
      I chose this book series as my greatest of all time as it was the only
      thing at the ripe old age of 12, that changed what I was interested in so
      drastically that it still holds 1st place. It not only shaped my interests
      it also gave me a perspective in life that I believe eventually changed
      who I was as a person.

    <p>
      The author portrayed characters so organically that I began modeling who I
      wanted to be on Eragon and conflict was done so naturally that I felt the
      Eragon's rage when events happen to cause it.
